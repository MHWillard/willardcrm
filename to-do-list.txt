WILLARDCRM (DESKTOP CONTACT MANAGER) TO-DO LIST

THE MVP:
- List contacts on left side panel.
- Have contact details appear on right-side panel (they appear when you click on a contact name).
- Contact details: name, relationship, interests, notes

LATER FEATURES:
- Right-side contact details let you edit any field.
- Updates: you can put an update on each contact which marks the current date and lets you write a note, to serve as a last contact date.
- Can edit or delete each update.

NOTES
- This is more of a GUI and intended for reminder automation, but the actual data will probably be in JSON format, this way we can grab key/value pairs and process appropriately, and won't have to worry about a DB.
- We can simulate UI interactions and mocks using Avalonia's headless functionality.
- We want to make sure we're clearing out the contacts folder and not pushing it to the repo.

**********
MVP STEPS
X Contacts get written as JSON files to local app directory.
X App can read local JSON files in the app directory and convert them to contactItems or grab their values.
X The left pane lists every contact in the local directory. If you manually create the correct JSON in the folder, it will show up on the left.
- The right pane lists the details of the contact, pulled from the JSON.
- Selecting a contact on the left pane loads the details on the right.

OTHER FEATURES
- Clicking the Add button lets you fill out a form for contact information and it saves the contact as a JSON in the contacts folder.
- Selecting a contact and clicking Delete deletes the contact and the local JSON.
