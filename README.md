# WillardCRM

willardCRM is a small desktop personal contact manager using Avalonia UI. I'm piggybacking off of [Avalonia's tutorial for a to-do list application](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/next/tutorials/todo-list-app/) to jumpstart it for use as a CRM.

## Features
* Contacts stored on disk as JSON files.
* Can add contacts via form.
* Can select contact and delete with Delete button.
* Select a contact on the left pane to see the details on the right pane.

Features I'd like to add over time:
* Ability to edit contacts.
* Ability to add regular successive notes to each contact.
* Built-in reminder system to touch base with a contact.

## Installation

To be added.
